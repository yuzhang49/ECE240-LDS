# ECE240-LDS
This repository contains the teaching materials for ECE240, Introduction to Linear Dynamical Systems, at UC Santa Cruz.
I would like to thank my colleagues, Professors Gabe Elkaim and Steve McGuire at UC Santa Cruz, for generously sharing their teaching resources. This course builds upon the Introduction to Linear Dynamical Systems sequence (EE263 and EE363) offered at Stanford University. The lecture notes are adapted from materials developed by Professors Stephen Boyd (Fall 2007) and Sanjay Lall (Fall 2025).
